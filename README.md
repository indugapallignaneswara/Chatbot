# Negotiation Chatbot

## Overview
This negotiation chatbot simulates a price negotiation process between a customer and a supplier using a pre-trained AI model (e.g., ChatGPT or Gemini). The bot is designed to engage users in a conversational flow, manage offers, and simulate realistic negotiations for purchasing a product (a book in this case).

## Key Features

1. **Basic Conversation Flow**:
   - The chatbot initiates a conversation asking if the user is interested in purchasing a book.
   - Users can express their intent to buy, propose an offer, and negotiate prices.

2. **Pricing Logic**:
   - A standard price of 500 rupees is used for the book.
   - Offers below the standard price are rejected with a rationale on manufacturing costs.
   - Offers at or above the standard price are accepted, allowing the transaction to proceed.

3. **User Interaction**:
   - The bot accepts user input for desired prices and responds accordingly.
   - It provides tailored responses, simulating a realistic price negotiation.

4. **Model Integration**:
   - The chatbot integrates with a pre-trained AI model to handle conversational aspects.
   - API calls are used to process user inputs and generate bot responses.

## Integration Steps

### 1. Set Up the Environment
   - Ensure Python is installed, along with required libraries such as `rasa` and `rasa-sdk`.
   - Install any additional dependencies for the selected AI model (e.g., OpenAI API).

### 2. Define Intents and Entities
   - In `domain.yml`, define intents such as `greet`, `offer`, and `confirm`.
   - Use entities like `amount` to capture the userâ€™s price offers.

### 3. Implement Actions
   - Implement custom actions (e.g., `ActionHandleOffer`) to manage negotiation logic.
   - Use the AI model to generate responses based on user inputs during the negotiation process.

### 4. Model Integration
   - Use the API of the pre-trained AI model to handle user inputs and generate responses.
   - Make sure to securely handle API keys and provide error handling for API requests.

### 5. Testing and Deployment
   - Test the chatbot locally to ensure it responds correctly during the negotiation process.
   - Deploy the chatbot on a web server or cloud service for accessibility.

## Key Functions

- **ActionHandleOffer**: Handles negotiation logic by comparing the user's offer against the standard price and generating responses.
- **utter_message**: Sends appropriate messages to the user based on their input and negotiation status.
- **API Calls**: Ensure API calls to the AI model are correctly set up to process and respond to user queries in real-time.

## Example Interaction

```text
User: "Hello"
Bot: "Hello! Are you looking to buy a book or just browsing?"

User: "I want to buy a book."
Bot: "The standard price for the book is 500 rupees. What would you like to offer?"

User: "I would like to offer 250 rupees."
Bot: "Our manufacturing cost is more than the quoted amount. We can't sell our product for less than our profit margin."

User: "Okay, then I will offer 550 rupees."
Bot: "Your offer of 550 has been accepted. Shall we proceed further with the payment and address details?"

User: "Let's proceed."
Bot: "Goodbye! Have a great day!"
```
